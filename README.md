## Revisiting Sinatra with Lynda tutorial

https://www.lynda.com/Sinatra-tutorials/

* Simple web application framework (barebones)
* http://www.sinatrarb.com

## Summary:

* Named after Frank Sinatra
* Written in Ruby
* Routes browser requests to code
* Renders templates as a response
* Leanest possible version of Ruby on Rails
* Simple, lightweight web applications
* Fast and low memory requirements
* Add features only as needed
* Create specialised, custom features

## What we need?
- Ruby
- Ruby Gems
- Sinatra (is a ruby gem)
- Thin (lightweight fast webserver, Sinatra will pick it up)

Initialization file (index.rb)
- Require Sinatra RubyGem
- route definition
=> Run server (in terminal ```ruby index.rb``` - open browser)

## Define Routes
```
get '/' do
"Hello World!" - pattern that matches the URL requests
end
```

## Route HTTP methods
- HTTP method + URL-matching pattern + code
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- GET: URLs and links
- POST: form submissions

## Route patterns
- Literal strings
- Regular Expressions
- Wildcard characters
- Named parameters

## Route Parameters
- Named wildcard matches
- Stored in params hash

```
get 'company/*' do
#all splats stored in an array
subject = params[:splat].first
  "You requested: #{subject}"
end

get '/company/:subject' do
  "You requested: #{params[:subject]}"
end

get '/products' do
#GET /products?page=3&sort=alpha
  "Showing products on page #{params[:page]},
sorted by #{params[:sort]}"
end
```
- Query parameters work the same way, they can be stored in params
- It is easier to name our splats from the start

## Redirect requests
- Sending a 302 status code to the browser with the new URL
- Browser gets it and requests it automatically, kind of like ping pong

```
get '/company/history' do
  redirect('/company/about-us')
end
```
- Can be also part of a condition, lets say product id is bigger than 100, redirect to home page

## Templates
- App has sturcture usually
- app.rb plus folder for public and folder for views
- root is by default: ```File.dirname(__FILE__)```
- can be changed: e.g. ```set :root, '/var/www/myproject'```
- once it knows where root is, it defaults to public folder

## Rendering Static Files
* Sinatra first looks for matching routes
* searches for matching file in the public directory then checks routes actually
* no routes needed for stylesheets, JS and images
* code block can return any static file (e.g. File.read(filepath)

## Rendering templates
- Formatted documents, meant to be requested
- Code makes templates dynamic
- Supports many template languages (ERB, Haml, Builder, Markdown, Textile)

```
get '/year' do
template = "The year is <%= Time.now.year %>."
erb template
end

get '/year' do
# returns 'views/year.erb'
erb :year
end
```
When you want to render a file, use a symbol! (views directory is the default place it will look for it)

## erb
- very flexible, can drop in and out
```<% Time.now %>
   <%= Time.now %>
```

```
<h1>Quick Nav</h1>

<%
quick_nav = [
  ['Home', '/', 'Our home page'], ['Tours', '/tours.html', 'Explore our tours'],["Mission", '/mission.html', 'What we think'],['Resources', '/resources.html', 'Guidance and planning'],['Explorers', '/explorers.html', 'oin our community'],['Contact', '/contact.html', 'Contact and support']
]
%>

<ul id="quickNav">
  <% quick_nav.each do |item| %>
  <li>
  <a href="<%= item[1] %>" title="<%= item[2]%>"><%= item[0]%></a>
  </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

The second one will actually show the time, but this way we can include all sorts of Ruby code in our HTML file.

## Template variables
- Several types of variables, scope
- local and instance (@) are the most often used, scope is the big difference
- we can also render partials using erb, we just need to make sure they are referenced as symbols

## Layouts
- render template inside common page elements (e.g. HTML head, header, footer, navigation, and sidebar)
- we have to put the in the layout file, yield to template and then finish

*** Start of layout ***
```
<%= yield %>
```
*** End of layout ***

It basically says the template code drops in here.
- Just drop a file in views with the name of layout.erb (magic! name)

## Built in helpers and filters
- has a few built-in
```
redirect
send_file
```
- you can define your own too:

```
helpers do
  def method_name(args)
    #
  end
end
```
## Escape html
- we always want to escape any dynamic content before we drop it onto our html page
- that dynamic content may not be safe
- especially if that content had a user before, might be harmful, could break our code

```
<a href='/show_user?id=24'>
  <%= @username %>
</a>

@username = "<script>alert('Gotcha');></script>"
```
This case the user would manage to put JS to our page, but if we wrap it in a harmless html, text, we can avoid trouble.
